# Task Management App
This is a Task Management application built using Flutter with GetX for state management, SQLite for local data storage, and Firebase for cloud backup. The app allows users to create, edit, delete, and organize their tasks. It supports local data persistence via SQLite and synchronization with Firebase for data backup and accessibility across devices.

## Features
  Task Creation: Users can add new tasks with a title, description, and optional deadline.
  
  Task Editing: Users can update tasks to reflect any changes.
  
  Task Deletion: Users can remove completed or unnecessary tasks.
  
  Local Storage: All tasks are stored locally using SQLite, so they are available offline.
  
  Firebase Sync: Tasks are backed up and synchronized with Firebase, enabling access across multiple devices.
  
  GetX State Management: Used for efficient and reactive state handling within the app.
  
  User Authentication: Optional Firebase Authentication to sync tasks with a user account.

  
## Tech Stack
  Flutter: Cross-platform framework used to develop the application.
  
  GetX: State management solution for managing app states, dependencies, and routing.
  
  SQLite: Local database for storing tasks offline.
  
  Firebase: Cloud storage for task synchronization and optional user authentication.
